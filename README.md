 This project is a Simon Says Game, a memory-based game where players must repeat a randomly generated sequence of colors.
 Each level increases the sequence length, challenging the playerâ€™s memory. The game features interactive buttons, visual 
 feedback, and a level-up system to enhance user engagement.
